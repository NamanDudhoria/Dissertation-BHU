Key Objectives

To analyze statistical relationships between ratio-based and non-ratio-based performance indicators of mutual funds in India.

To descriptively summarize the factors affecting mutual fund performance by category.

To identify associations between mutual fund categories, managerial decisions, and their performance.

Research Methodology

Data Collection: Secondary data sourced from IndianMutualFunds.com

Analysis Techniques:

Descriptive Statistics (e.g., central tendency measures)

Inferential Statistics (e.g., correlation analysis, Chi-square test for association)

Sampling Strategy: Purposive sampling of mutual funds across various categories

Key Findings

Debt mutual funds are relatively stable, with low volatility and consistent returns, making them a safer investment option.

Equity mutual funds exhibit higher potential for returns but come with increased volatility.

There is a strong positive correlation between 3-year and 5-year returns, indicating that fundamentally strong funds tend to perform well over time.

The decline in New Fund Offerings (NFOs) in 2023 suggests a shift toward passive investment strategies.

Performance indicators such as Sharpe Ratio, Sortino Ratio, and Alpha provide valuable insights, but their lack of strong correlation with each other suggests a need for a more comprehensive index.

Statistical tests confirm significant associations between fund category, asset management companies, and returns.

Conclusion & Recommendations

Diversification: Investors should consider a mix of fund categories to mitigate risk.

Long-term Perspective: Short-term market fluctuations should not heavily influence investment decisions.

Selection of AMCs: Choosing funds managed by reputable AMCs with a track record of strong management is crucial.

Regulatory Awareness: Investors should stay updated on regulatory changes impacting mutual funds.
